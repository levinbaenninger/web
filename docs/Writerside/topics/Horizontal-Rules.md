                      Ron was backed into a corner by the marauding netherbeasts. Scared, but
                      determined to protect his friends, he raised his wand and prepared to do
                      battle, hoping that his distress call had made it through.
                </p>
                <hr />
                <p>
                      Meanwhile, Harry was sitting at home, staring at his royalty statement and
                      pondering when the next spin off series would come out, when an enchanted
                      distress letter flew through his window and landed in his lap. He read it
                      hazily and sighed; "better get back to work then", he mused.
